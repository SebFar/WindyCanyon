# WindyCanyon
In Sutton and Barto, chapter 6 there are 4 exercises involving the Windy Canyon (with udlr, with king-moves, with king-moves plus stationary, with stochastic wind). This code has been used to solve each, but needs tweaking between runs.

WindyCanyon is the main file, which saves runs to SARSAscores. DisplayData shows a graph based on SARSAscores. "With stochastic.png" shows the output of this script after my first full run through it.
